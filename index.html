                              <p>Sorry for the lack of a newsletter last week. I had all the good intentions of getting one out, but I think I spent most of the evening watching <em>Took Many Cooks</em> on YouTube instead.</p>
                              <p>This issue brings with it the news that new member <a href="https://talk.birmingham.io/users/woo/">Andy Wootton</a> has suggested a name for the newsletter: <em>Formatted Transput</em> - his justification being that it means <a href="https://talk.birmingham.io/t/im-starting-a-weekly-newsletter/635/17">"formatted IO"</a>. Personally I think this is an excellent name, but I'd like to know what you think.</p>
                              <p>Also new with this issue are some additional types of content, specifically links to popular discussions from the forum, notifications of new members, and more content from Planet Birmingham.</p>
                              <p><em>I hope you enjoy it...</em></p>
