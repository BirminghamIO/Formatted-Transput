Stocked full of devices ready to be used for testing websites and applications, they’d like to invite people to come and use the facility.</p>
                              <p>If you’ve got a drawer full of old devices that you’d like to give a better life to, maybe think about donating them, as your donation will be grateful received and will put them to good use.</p>

                              <p>Hopefully however, this has given you an idea of the type of content this newsletter will feature. What would you keep and/or change? What do you think of the layout of the content?</p>
                              <p>All feedback, positive or negitive, will be greatfully received.</p>
